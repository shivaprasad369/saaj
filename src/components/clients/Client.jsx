                    happy to chat as when needed and not even once he fixed the

                    It was my sister's wedding in December 2021 and we somehow
                    we couldn't book Wedding planner till December first week. I
                    met Saaj wedding team 10 days before the wedding and was
                    convinced in the first meeting that they have understood
                    what work I'm expecting in the wedding. To my surprise, when
                    I reached the venue in each of the event, the decor was
                    simply beyond my expectations.

                                It was my sister's wedding in December 2021 and
                                we somehow we couldn't book Wedding planner till
                                December first week. I met Saaj wedding team 10
                                days before the wedding and was convinced in the
                                first meeting that they have understood what
                                work I'm expecting in the wedding. <br/>To my
                                surprise, when I reached the venue in each of
                                the event, the decor was simply beyond my
                                expectations. The team puts in all the efforts
                                and is very professional and easy to work with.
                                I would definitely recommend Saaj weddings for
                                every event big or small. Infact I will be using
                                them for all my future events as well{" "}

                    food and all the other wedding arrangements, they were just

                                only just happy but they were so mesmerized by
                                the hospitality they have been indulged in.<br/> One
                                of the best things about the team was that they
                                fulfilled our every last minute demands that too
                                without any haphazard. The both the presentation
                                and the authentic taste of the food were
                                outstanding and they also kept in mind our every
                                minute details about the whole process of
                                wedding.<br/> Initially, we were little worried about
                                the decorations as every wedding is nevertheless
                                same but Saaj put all its efforts to make the
                                venue grand and unique just the way we wanted to
                                be. <br/>I am contented with the level of proficiency
                                and level of expertise they worked in their
                                arena the level of satisfaction they provided us

                              work on: <br />- Breakdown of price by different
                              wedding activity components. It helps client get
                              clarity on what is at what price, rather than a
                              wholesome price. I understand it could be
                              challenging to get this, but from a client
                              perspective it helps to gain trust.
                              <br /> - He is very adjusting to make sure the
                              event is memorable for the family and he could
                              continue to do the same, specially during the
